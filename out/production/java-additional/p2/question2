Write a Java program to create a base class called Bicycle with member variables (gear speed, color) of type integer and string, methods (applyBrake(int decrement), speedUp(int increment)) and constructors Bicycle(int gear, int speed, int color).
Derive subclass called MountainBike from the superclass Bicycle with member variable (height) of type integer, public methods (setHeight(int newValue)) and its constructors(MountainBike(int gear,int speed,String color, int startHeight)).
Create the two instances of MountainBikes and print similar Mountain bikes if the color and number of gears of mountain bikes are same.
Demonstrate the code reuse and Inheritance properties of Object oriented programming by inheriting the constructors and methods of the base class.
