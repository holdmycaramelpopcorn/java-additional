Write a Java program to demonstrate the following. A company pays its employees weekly. The employees are of three types.
a) Salaried employees are paid a fixed weekly salary regardless of the number of
hours worked.
b) Commission employees are paid a percentage of their sales and
c) Base_salary_plus_commission employees receive a base salary plus percentage
of their sales.
For the current pay period, the company has decided a reward for base_salary_plus_commission employees by adding 10 percent to their base salaries.
The company wants to implement a Java program that performs its payroll calculations polymorphically.
Design and implement the program using inheritance. Implement the methods to read and write the employee details (like name, emp_id, salary, etc), to compute the employeeâ€˜s gross salary.
